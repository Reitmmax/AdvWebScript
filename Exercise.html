		<h2>Mod 1</h2>
		<h3><a href="exercises/pig/index.html" target="_blank">Pig</a></h3>
		<p>This exercise is called "Pig". The goal of the game is to get to 10 points. It is a 2 player game. You click to roll and add the total you get for each roll, if you roll a 1, you lose the points you get then pass the turn to the next player. You can choose to "hold" which allows you to pass the turn and keep all your points.</p>
		<p>This teaches how to use numbers in JavaScript code. It also reteaches loops, how to set constants and variables, and how to change the variables within the loop.</p>
		
		<h3><a href="exercises/countdown/index.html" target="_blank">Countdown</a></h3>
		<p>This exercise is called "Countdown". This is a timer that tells how long (or long ago) a date is.</p>
		<p>This teaches how to put restrictions on information and how to keep it validated, and change responses depending on what was typed in the textboxes.</p>
		<h2>Mod 2</h2>
<!--		<h3><a href="" target="_blank">project</a></h3>-->
		<h3><a href="exercises/swapper/index.html" target="_blank">Swapper</a></h3>
		<p>This is a page with images on it. Whenever you click the image on top, it changes the image and the title of the image you are looking at. It does this by using a tags and switching the src of the page to whatever is in the href, and changes the caption to whatever the title is set to on the image.</p>
		
		<h3><a href="exercises/tabs/index.html" target="_blank">Tabs</a></h3>
		<p>Whenever the header is clicked, it toggles .show and .hide. When clicked at first, it changes the + to - and displays text below the tab. Whenever clicked again, it changes - back to + and hides the text it displayed. </p>
		
		<h2>Mod 3</h2>
		<h3><a href="exercises/slideshow/index.html" target="_blank">Slideshow</a></h3>
		<p>When you first enter the page, the images start going through a slideshow. During the slideshow, the images fade in and out. If you want to look at an image for longer, you can click on the image to stop the slideshow, then you can click it again to start the slideshow up again.</p>
		<h3><a href="exercises/jQuery flowers/index.html" target="_blank">Flowers</a></h3>
		<p>Whenever you scroll on this page, the title disappears and reappears when you scroll back to the top. You'll also notice that the body text is also animated, but whenever its scrolled away from, it does not reset the animation. If you were to click my name on the footer, you will see a little emoji slide out and the arrow pointing changes. If you click it again, it hides the emoji.</p>
			
			<h2>Mod 4</h2>
			<h3><a href="exercises/member_form/index.html" target="_blank">Member Form</a></h3>
			<p>This was created to basically check the parameters of what is typed in the form. It makes sure that the phone number and email are formatted correctly (e.i. "test@email.com" and "123-123-1234". It also makes sure the form is completed and have the required information.</p>
			<h3><a href="exercises/plugin_ui/index.html" target="_blank" >Plugin UI</a></h3>
			<p>This webpage showcases how to use plugins and jQuery UI. The plugin used is called "Paralax". It is what is giving the background images the scrolling effects. We also used jQuery UI, which allowed us to make themes for the pages. This can change things like hover state or when something is active. In this specific webpage, we used a calendar UI. All I did for it was change some colors around.</p>
			<h2>Mod 5</h2>
		<h3><a href="exercises/m05_ex/m05.html" target="_blank">Node.js</a></h3>
		<p>In this project, we use Node.js and Command Prompt to load a script and give a result dependent on the code</p>
			<h2>Mod 6</h2>
		<h3><a href="exercises/arguments/argument.html" target="_blank">Node.js (continued)</a></h3>
		<p>We continue to use Node.js and Command Prompt.This time, we are putting arguments into the code that can be manipulated by what you put in the Command Prompt.</p>
		<h3><a href="exercises/tutorial/index.html">Object History</a></h3>
		<p>In this exercise, we use object history to navigate through web pages.</p>
		
		<h2>Mod 7</h2>
		<h3><a href="exercises/task_list_web/index.html" target="_blank">Web Storage</a></h3>
		<p>This project showcases how to create and manipulate local web storage. In this example, it allows you to write in something and store it to the local storage. It also displays what is inside said storage on the side. You can also clear the results, meaning that you delete them all</p>
		<h3><a href="exercises/http/http.html" target="_blank">HTTP Servers</a></h3>
		<p>In this exercise, we showcased how to have a webpage on a server. We made it so the server would reconize CSS, HTML, and PNG images and display them. It can display HTML through writing the code in the script OR linking to an external web page.</p>
		
		<h2>Mod 8</h2>
		<h3><a href="exercises/m08pack/index.html" target="_blank">JSON Package</a></h3>
		<p>We learned how to make a JSON package and how to use the package. We also learned how to use dependencies!</p>
		<h3><a href="exercises/express/exercise.html" target="_blank">Express</a></h3>
		<p>We learned how to use Express in a JSON package to allow us to use HTTP servers more effieciently.</p>

		<h2>Mod 9</h2>
		<h3><a href="exercises/photo_viewer/" target="_blank">AJAX</a></h3>
		<p>We use AJAX and APIs to shift through images. The album goes from 1-5000.</p>
		<h3><a href="exercises/simple_fetch/" target="_blank">Simple Fetch</a></h3>
		<p>We use APIs to make the page. This exercise uses the fetch function to get information from the API.</p>
		<h2>Mod 10</h2>
		<h3><a href="exercises/api queries/index.html" target="_blank">API Queries</a></h3>
		<p>We created a server that filters data depending on what is put in the URL. We use both Queries and Parameters to achieve this.</p>
		<h3><a href="exercises/task_list/index.html" target="_blank">Task List</a></h3>
		<p>We create Arrays that are filtered by date using the Map object</p>
		<h2>Mod 11</h2>
		<h3><a href="exercises/event/project.html" target="_blank">Events</a></h3>
		<p>We learned how to make an event</p>
		<h3><a href="exercises/streams/project.html" target="_blank">Streams</a></h3>
		<p>We learned how to stream code</p>
		<h2>Mod 12</h2>
		<h3><a href="exercises/middleware/project.html" target="_blank">Middleware and Routing</a></h3>
