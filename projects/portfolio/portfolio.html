		<h1>Max Reitmayer | 6669 Rando St Town, State 12345 | Email@email.com</h1>
		<p>I am a web developer! I am currently getting my Associates for Web Development. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and graphic design. After college, I want to start working more professionally with these programs. My goal is to make cohesive designs, may it be for webpages or grapics in general.</p>

		<p>These are animations I have made over the years. These were for an animation class in college. This showcases how I can use and manipulate shapes to make compelling animations for people. They are usuable on websites as well!</p>

		<button><a href="https://reitmmax.github.io/HTMLCSS/">Check out the page here!</a></button>
		<p>This was my first HTML page I made for college. This class taught me the basics: how to structer a page, how to make links, how to manipulate elements with CSS, how the hierarchy of a page works, and how to use iframes. This was they very beginning of my journey!</p>
	
	<h2 class="slide">Adv HTML CSS</h2>
	<iframe width="1920" height="720" src="https://reitmmax.github.io/AdvHTML/" allowfullscreen> </iframe>
		<br>
		<button><a href="https://reitmmax.github.io/AdvHTML/">Check out the page here!</a></button>
		<p>This was a page I made later down the line! Another college page that taught me resposive design, how to make webpages accessible, how to use CSS and JavaScript to animate my pages, how to use a flexbox and grid, how to use SVGs and manipulate their content, how to disect a webpage, and how to use SASS. </p>
		
	<h2 class="slide">JavaScript</h2>
	<iframe width="1920" height="720" src="https://reitmmax.github.io/JavaSCript2/assignments.html"> </iframe>
		<br>
		<button><a href="https://reitmmax.github.io/JavaSCript2/assignments.html">Check out the page here!</a></button>
		<p>This was another one of my early pages. I learned how to use loops and arrays, how to write out and alert prompts, and how to do basic math with loops</p>
		
	<h2 class="slide">Adobe XD</h2>
	<iframe width="1920" height="720" src="https://xd.adobe.com/embed/40acf4d8-793e-404d-bc19-76da911b8021-15ff/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		<br>
	<p>This was a page for a midterm I made. I used Adobe XD to make it. It helped me use different transitions to other pages and on buttons. It also taught me how to prototype webpages before starting to make the actual thing.</p>
		
		<h2 class="slide">PHP/Capstone</h2>
		<iframe width="1920" height="720" src="https://max.webstupet.com/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		<br>
		<button><a href="https://max.webstupet.com/">Check out the page here!</a></button>
		
		<p>This was a page I made for my capstone class. It uses PHP, HTML, and CSS. This was supposed to be a portfolio site. I use PHP in the code to separate parts (like the footer and navbar) so I can call them whenever I need. This also has a lot of CSS animations</p>
