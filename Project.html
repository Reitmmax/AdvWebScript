		<p id="landing"> This page will be showcasing projects I have done throughout the semester!</p>
		<h2>Mod 1</h2>
		<h3>Workspace</h3>
		<p>These webpages are my first project! I will be using the page to showcase what I have learned throughout the semester! The exercises are small coding projects learning the concept of the module and the projects are applying the concepts learned from the module </p>
		<h2>Mod 2</h2>
		<h3><a href="projects/Page Manipulation/manipulate.html" target="_blank">Page Manipulation</a></h3>
		<p>This project is to showcase how to manipulate web pages. This has a little button bar on top of the page. Whenever a button is clicked, the code has it display the info from the button pushed and hides the other divs using .hide() and .show().</p>
		<h2>Mod 3</h2>
		<h3><a href="projects/portfolio/portfolio.html" target="_blank">Motion Page</a></h3>
		<p>This project is a resume page with animations. I used .fadeIn() and .animate() in this assignment. The goal was to show case my design of a portfolio while using animations to help make the page stand out.</p>
		
		<h2> Mod 4</h2>
		<h3><a href="projects/jQueryUI/jqueryui.html" target="_blank">jQuery UI</a></h3>
		<p>This page is to showcase how to use jQuery UI plugins and widgets. I made a very basic page for ordering a pizza. I let the user choose their toppings, type of crust, and how many pizzas they want. I also made a second page to display the progress of the pizza being made.</p>
		
		<h2>Mod 5</h2>
		<h3><a href="projects/node.js/pokemon.html" target="_blank">Pokeapp</a></h3>
		<p>I made an app that chooses a favorite Pokemon at random. This goes through a loop and tells you which one of the 5 Pokemon is my favorite using Node.js and command prompt.</p>
			
			
			<h2>Mod 6</h2>
			<h3><a href="projects/arguments node.js/argument.html" target="_blank">Age Bot</a></h3>
			<p>I made an app that takes your name and birth year and tells you what your age is. "I am x and I was born in XXXX. I am XX years old."</p>
		
		<h2>Mod 7</h2>
		<h3><a href="projects/http/project.html" target="_blank">HTTP and Web Storage</a></h3>
		<p>In this project, I made a HTTP server for my pages, as well as a web storage app that is a calculator. The HTTP server has an index page, a 404 page, a style sheet, a .jpg, the main project page, and a javascript loaded on it. My calculator app uses web storage to store previous equations and display their results</p>
		
		<h2>Mod 8</h2>
		<h3><a href="projects/package_application/project.html" target="_blank">JSON App</a></h3>
		<p>This was a simple addition app using node.js and its packages! This project used the NPMs Express and Body-Parser.</p>
		
		<h2>Mod 9</h2>
		<h3><a href="projects/api/api.html" target="_blank">API Project</a></h3>
		<p>I used a Magic: The Gathering API to make a card searcher. If you type in the name of a card, like "cultivate", it will tell you its name, what it does, how much it costs, and what set the card is from.</p>
		
		<h2>Mod 10</h2>
		<h3><a href="projects/api queries/index.html">API Project Queries</a></h3>
		<p>I made an API that lets you search for artists, songs, and albums using queries and parameters.</p>
		
		<h2>Mod 11</h2>
		<h3><a href="projects/Streams and Events/project.html">Streams and Events</a></h3>
		<p>I made a simple project to stream text to a file and have the user have several inputs.</p>
		<h2>Mod 12</h2>
		<h3><a href="projects/middleware/project.html">Middleware and Routes</a></h3>
		<p>I made a simple page that displays data about music arists using middleware and routes.</p>
